                <h3>John Lennon's Life:</h3>
                <p>
                    John Winston Lennon was born on October 9, 1940, in
                    Liverpool, Merseyside, England, during a German air raid in
                    World War II. As a child, Lennon was a prankster and he
                    enjoyed getting into trouble.
                </p>

                    Elvis Presley's explosion onto the rock music scene inspired
                    a 16-year-old Lennon to create the skiffle band called the
                    Quarry Men, named after his school. Lennon met Paul
                    McCartney at a church fete on July 6, 1957. He soon invited
                    McCartney to join the group, and the two eventually formed
                    one of the most successful songwriting partnerships in
                    musical history.

                    The Beatles were discovered by Brian Epstein in 1961 at
                    Liverpool's Cavern Club, where they were performing on a
                    regular basis.

                    Lennon married Cynthia Powell in August 1962. The couple had
                    one son together, Julian, who was named after Lennon's
                    mother. Cynthia was forced to keep a very low profile during
                    Beatlemania. She and Lennon divorced in 1968. He remarried
                    the following year, on March 20, 1969, to Japanese
                    avant-garde artist Yoko Ono, whom he had met at the Indica
                    Gallery in November 1966.
